/**
 * Types describing the slices of the Tonal API we consume.
 *
 * Tonal has no public API and no published schema. `ts-tonal-client` wraps the
 * activity summaries and the movement catalog, but NOT the per-set detail
 * endpoint (`/users/{userId}/workout-activities/{activityId}`) that carries the
 * reps and weights — those shapes were established by inspecting live responses.
 *
 * Every field is optional and loose on purpose: Tonal can change this payload
 * without warning, and parsing must never hard-fail on an unexpected shape.
 * `normalizeWorkout()` in fit.ts handles the fallbacks. If Tonal does change
 * something, `npm run verify` prints the field names it actually sees against
 * your own account, so you can tell what moved.
